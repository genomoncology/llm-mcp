      REQUIREMENT: When expected_replacements=1 (default), include the minimal\\n
      \                       amount of context necessary (typically 1-3 lines) before
      and after the change point,\\n                        with exact whitespace
      and indentation.\\n                        \\n                        When editing
      multiple sections, make separate edit_block calls for each distinct change\\n
      \                       rather than one large replacement.\\n                        \\n
      \                       When a close but non-exact match is found, a character-level
      diff is shown in the format:\\n                        common_prefix{-removed-}{+added+}common_suffix

      to write_file, there is a configurable line limit (fileWriteLineLimit) that
      warns\\n                        if the edited file exceeds this limit. If this
      happens, consider breaking your edits into\\n                        smaller,
